I do agree to the statement that children brought up in poor families.
Children of poor parents are prematurely exposed to problems of adult life e.g. learning to survive on a low family income and sacrificing luxuries for essential items. These children began to see the 'realities' of life in their home or social environment. Their parents own struggles serve as an example to them.
These children are taught necessary skills for survival as an adult from a very early age. Many children eg work in the weekends to either collect some pocket money or even contribute to their families' income. A good example is the many children who accompany their parents to sell produce at the market. They are making a direct contribution to their families in terms of labor or income.
Children of poor families also are highly motivated. They tend to set high goals to improve their economic and social situation. A relevant example would be Mister Bill Gates (founder of Microsoft Corporation) He had an impoverished background but he used his talent and motivation to set up the worlds largest computer organization.
However, there are some problems that children from poor backgrounds encounter. Many of these children who are 'robbed' of their childhood eg while working, may feel cheated. They often turn to crime. This however, is a small group.
In summing up, children with impoverished backgrounds are able to deal with problems of adult life because of early exposure, family role models and sheer motivation.
