I greatly support the idea. I support it, because of the following reasons.
raise in a certain psychological values. Such as the value of hard work, discipline, they are used to be in the condition where money does not come easily. They have to earn it, work for it. Oppose to it, a child who comes from a wealthy family is used to have money all the time. Whenever they want something, the money is easily gave to them as if every day are their birthday.
well-trained to face adulthood. They are well-prepared to see the fact that the world is a very tough place. They watched their parent every day worked very hard just to put food in the table. They have the advantage to see the reality and embrace it, set their mind that they too have work hard for their future, their own dreams, their authentic self. A child that came from a wealthy family does not always have the advantage. This is because their eyes are blinded by the power of money, that their parent has. They also have a disadvantage of a family love life. Commonly wealthy parents express love by money. They love their children, so they bought them cars, expensive clothes, toys, but they are never home when their children needs them. The basic necessity of compassion is not fulfilled in this kind of family. The impact to a child is that they will grow up and think that money is everything, that the source of happiness is money. They do not care about other people, they only care about money. The problem is they do not know how to get it, they have been spoiled all the time, so does not have the time to discovered the art of money making, only money spending. On the contrary, children from  will grow up with the sense of respect for money, they know how to get it and use it well. They know how to face adult life problems because they have been watching since they were a child. But a wealthy child is always too busy with himself to know that.
