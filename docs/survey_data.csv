In paragraph 1, there are instances of lexical usage that are minimally adequate for the task ('I disagree', which should be 'I disagree with' / I show).  One key is that some parts are markedly different than others due to the writer's recycling of words from the prompt.

The phrases 'in a certain ethical values' and 'spoiled in every time'  demonstrate both adequate vocabulary and a degree of inaccuracy.  The listing in the 'such as' fragment also seems like they are trying to include a range of vocabulary to earn a higher score without explaining why they attributed these words to the situation.

",7+,7+,7+,7,7.4,"There are some inaccuracies in collocation.  The writer uses 'early exposure' in the final paragraph, which I would guess refers to the clause with 'exposed' in an earlier paragraph; however, the collocation is left with a clear link, as 'early exposure' could also refer to such situations as photography.  

Many precise meanings are conveyed here.  'Turn to' indicates a proper casual relationship.  The word 'realities' is in single quotes for some reason, yet the word itself is used properly.  The word 'impoverished (though Bill Gates' family in truth had money) is used well within the context of the writing.  The words/phrases 'encounter' and 'direct contribution' (though the latter is slightly out of context here) are used in a fluent and uncommon way.  

Most word formation errors come from issues with possessives (ex: worlds -- > world's & parent's / parents'); both errors change the meaning of the phrase of sentence unless the reader can sense what the writer means.
