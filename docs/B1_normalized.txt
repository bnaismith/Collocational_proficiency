I disagree that point about children brought up in families are prepared their life and then are good parents. because, I show that situation around me at our country parents. They want they had everything give to their children and also could buying things like positive school. but, their behavior is not good effect to them
On the other hand, children brought up by wealthy parents, they are strong, that means they can be prepare with many problems of being adults. They working to have money, that could buy everything they want
In my case, I start work from twenty ages I start work My country and work as a journalist for money I had social experience and I got a money for myself. however, My age is late to work by children ages and I heard about children doing work by another countries that countries had a culture about children They start work when they fifteen, and it is very young. They doing work for their pocket money and is good.
they could their money buy something or entrance to the bank. that is good they could buy something. now and for future time. also, our country children do this. but, many children accept the money by their parents. which persons got a pocket money over the twenty ages. but I am very disagree with that. I think, if children had a work and they study at money, they perfectly prepared their adult life after they must be parents.
